A more modern version of https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle.
The build currently succeeds, and you can use it as-is.
Build command:
xcodebuild -project tiny_window_manager.xcodeproj -scheme tiny_window_manager -configuration Release build 2>&1
A working build is available in the Releases section, or you can build it yourself.
It's still in development—more features to come!

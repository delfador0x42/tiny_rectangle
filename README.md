# tiny_rectangle

A more modern version of [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle).

The build currently succeeds, and you can use it as-is.

## Build command

```bash
xcodebuild -project tiny_window_manager.xcodeproj -scheme tiny_window_manager -configuration Release build 2>&1
```

A working build is available in the Releases section, the .app bundled in .zip, or you can build it yourself.

It's still in development — more to come!

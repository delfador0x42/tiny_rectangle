A more modern version of https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle

As of now build succeeds and you can use this as is 

Build:: xcodebuild -project tiny_window_manager.xcodeproj -scheme tiny_window_manager -configuration Release build 2>&1

Current working build in releases or you can build on your own

But still in development ... more to come
